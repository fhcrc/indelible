    /*
      [ancestralprint]
      * _NEW_ will print ancestral sequences in a separate file to leaf sequences.
      * _SAME_ prints ancestral sequences in the same file as the leaf sequences.
      * _FALSE_ will not print any ancestral sequences.
      * It should be noted that if you used different guide trees for different partitions 
        in a partitioned (multi-gene) analysis then only the root sequence will be printed 
        in the SAME/NEW file specified in this command.
    
      [output]
      * Unaligned sequences are always output in FASTA format as e.g. filename.fas
      * This command sets the output type for the true alignment and prints it to a file 
        named e.g. filename_TRUE.phy
      * _FASTA_, _NEXUS_, _PHYLIP_ will print out sequences to file in either 
        fasta, nexus, or phylip format respectively. 
      * FASTA is used by NCBI and accepted by most sequence alignment programs.  
        NEXUS is used by e.g. MacClade, Mesquite, ModelTest, MrBayes and PAUP*.  
        PHYLIP is used by PHYLIP and PAML.
      * _PHYLIPT_ gives PHYLIP format with filenames truncated to 8 characters. 
    
      [phylipextension]
      * This command sets the file extension for true alignments in phylip format so they 
        are e.g. filename.phy or whatever you choose them to be.
    
      [nexusextension]
      * This command sets the file extension for true alignments in nexus format so they 
        are e.g. filename.nex or whatever you choose them to be.
    
      [fastaextension]
      * This command sets the file extension for fasta formatted output files so they 
        are e.g. filename.fas or whatever you choose them to be.
    
      [randomseed]
      * This must be an integer value and is used to seed the random number generator.
      * Running simulations with the same random seed value (and the same control file) 
        will produce identical datasets.
     
      [printrates]
      * _TRUE_ will print out a detailed output file for each replicate of each block 
        that lists what the site-classes or relative rates of substitution are.
      * _FALSE_ will not print any rates information.
      * Follow these links for examples of the output for [NUCLEOTIDE / AMINOACID](nucleotide_RATES.txt) simulations, 
        or for [CODON](codon_RATES.txt) simulations. 
      
      [markdeletedinsertions]
      * _TRUE_ will output inserted bases/residues that have been subsequently been 
        deleted as * rather than - for easy identification.
      * _FALSE_ leave everything as -.
      
      [insertaslowercase]
      * _TRUE_ will output inserted bases/residues as lower case letters for easy identification.
      * _FALSE_ will output all bases/residues as upper case letters.
      
      [printcodonsasaminoacids]
      * _TRUE_ will output codon datasets as amino-acids - how they are translated will 
        depend on the genetic code specified in the model.
      * _FALSE_ will print codons as nucleotide triplets.
    
      [fileperrep]
      * _TRUE_ will output each replicate dataset in a separate file.
        Unaligned sequences will go in e.g. filename_1.fas, filename_2.fas, etc
        The true alignment will go in e.g. filename_TRUE_1.phy, filename_TRUE_2.phy, etc
      * _FALSE_ will print all replicates in a single file.
        Unaligned sequences for each dataset will all go in e.g. filename.fas    
        All the true alignments will go in e.g. filename_TRUE.phy
      * If a file called paupstart.txt (or paupend.txt) exists in the same directory as 
        INDELible then it will be copied to the beginning (or end) of each file. 
      * If a file called paupmiddle.txt exists in the same directory as INDELible then it 
        will be copied to e.g. filename_TRUE.phy after each replicate datset.
      * These features are useful if you want to include PAUP or MrBayes blocks in your files.
